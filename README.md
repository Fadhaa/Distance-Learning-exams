## This repository contains two R Notebook files designed to create various exams on two topics: one on matrices within the Matrix module, and another on interpolation in Numerical Analysis.
### 1. The notebook created on Kaggle contains code that can be used for remote exams. This concept can be extended to apply to numerous subjects. To apply this code, just run the code on your R-project
#### https://github.com/Fadhaa/Distance-Learning-exams/blob/main/generation-diverse-questions-matrix-exam.ipynb
#### Please note that the output of the code is LaTeX code that can be executed by any LaTeX software. The output code is similar to this https://github.com/Fadhaa/Distance-Learning-exams/blob/main/diverse_questions_Matrix_Exam_latex_code.txt . The generated pdf file of all the questions look like https://github.com/Fadhaa/Distance-Learning-exams/blob/main/Matrix_diverse_exam.pdf .
#### The code also output the solution for all the questions generated as in this file https://github.com/Fadhaa/Distance-Learning-exams/blob/main/sol_diverse_questions_Matrix_Exam.txt

### 2. The notebook created on Kaggle contains code that can be used for remote exams. The topic of the exam is using one out of five different methods for interpolation of points. This concept can be extended to apply to numerous subjects. To apply this code, just run the code on your R-project
